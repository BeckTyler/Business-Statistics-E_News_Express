| Project Link | Area | Project Description | Libraries |    
|---|---|---|---|
| 📈 [Trade&Ahead](https://github.com/BeckTyler/python/blob/main/Tyler_Beck_ReneWind.ipynb) | Unsupervised Learning | Grouped stocks using multiple models based on the attributes provided, and shared insights about the characteristics of each group. | numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn |   
| 🍃 [ReneWind](https://github.com/BeckTyler/python/blob/main/Tyler_Beck_ReneWind.ipynb) | Model Tuning | Built various classification models and tuned them to find the best one that will help identify failures so that the generators could be repaired before failing/breaking to reduce the overall maintenance cost. | numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn |   
| ✈️ [EasyVisa](https://github.com/BeckTyler/python/blob/main/Tyler_Beck_EasyVisa.ipynb) | Ensemble Techniques | Facilitated the process of visa approvals, comparing and contrasting multiple models to recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied based on the drivers that significantly influence the case status. | numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn | 
| 🏨 [INN Hotels](https://github.com/BeckTyler/python/blob/main/Tyler_Beck_INN_Hotels.ipynb) | Supervised Learning - Classification | Analysis to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, built a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds. | numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn |   
| 🔋 [ReCell](https://github.com/BeckTyler/python/blob/main/Tyler_Beck_ReCell.ipynb) | Supervised Learning - Foundations | Built a linear regression model to predict the price of a used phone/tablet and identify factors that significantly influence it. | numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn |   
| 🗞️ [E-News Express](https://github.com/BeckTyler/python/blob/main/Tyler_Beck_E_News_Express.ipynb) | Business Statistics | A study on web traffic data comparing two different landing pages for a news organization. | numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn |
